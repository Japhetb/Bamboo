### Authentication with Guardian and Comeonin
 Guardian is an Elixir package for authentication and Comeonin for password encryption.
 We import Guardian in the config/config.exs. The secret key is generated by running:
 # mix guardian.gen.secret.

 ## Token
 I reate the tokens, decode them, refresh tokens and revoke them in BambooWeb.Auth.Guardian module.
 I use the Guardian function to create a JWT token after a user is created. I render “user.json” to send the JWT token as part of the response.
